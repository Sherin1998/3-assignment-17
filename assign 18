1. def hours():
    print('Open 9-5 daily')

import zoo
zoo.hours()

2.   import zoo as menagerie
menagerie.hours()

3.  3. To explicitly import and call the `hours()` function from `zoo`, you can do the following in the Python interpreter:

   This will output: `Open 9-5 daily`, which is the result of calling the `hours()` function from the `zoo` module.

4. To import the `hours()` function as `info` and call it, you can do the following:


   This will also output: `Open 9-5 daily`, as it is calling the `hours()` function from the `zoo` module but using the alias `info`.

5. To create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs `'a': 1`, `'b': 2`, and `'c': 3`, and print it, you can do the following:



   This will output: `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, which is the plain dictionary with the specified key-value pairs.

6. To create an OrderedDict called `fancy` from the same key-value pairs as in 5 and print it, you can use the following code:



   The output will be: `OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])`. The order is maintained in the `OrderedDict`, so it will print in the same order as the plain dictionary.

7. To make a defaultdict called `dict_of_lists` and pass it the argument `list`, then make the list `dict_of_lists['a']` and append the value `'something for a'` to it in one assignment, you can use the following code:


   This will output: `['something for a']`, as the `'something for a'` value is appended to the list associated with the key `'a'` in the `dict_of_lists` defaultdict.
