1. To add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string, you can use the following Python code:This code snippet first imports the date class from the datetime module. Then, it opens the file today.txt in write mode ('w') and writes the current date as a string using the write() method. The str() function is used to convert the date.today() object to a string.

2. To read the text file today.txt into the string today_string, you can use the following Python code:This code snippet opens the file today.txt in read mode ('r') and reads its contents into the string today_string using the read() method. The entire contents of the file are read as a single string.
3. To list the files in your current directory, you can use the os module:
4. To create a list of all files in your parent directory (assuming at least five files are available), you can use the following code:
